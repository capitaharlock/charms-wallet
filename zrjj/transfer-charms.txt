Transfer charms task

------------------------------
MAKE DIALOG
Read charms data and put it in a json
When click on transfer, open a dialog box
The dialog parses the json charm and creates this form in rows
row 0 - Title: Token/Nft Transfer
row 1 - prints the available amount (taken from the charm in the json)
row 2 - Add input box so the user can type the amount
row 3 - The button Start transfer

-------------------------------
CREATE THE SPELL
Once we know the amount, we need to build the spell based on the UTXO spell data, it will be a json with:

"""
version: 1

apps:
  $01: t/${app_id}/${app_vk} (TAKE IT FROM THE SOURCE UTXO + add the assets we're not touching)

ins:
  - utxo_id: ${in_utxo_1}
    charms:
      $01: 69420 (CALCULATE)

outs:
  - address: ${addr_3} (THE NEW RECIPIENT ADDRESS)
    charms:
      $01: 420

  - address: ${addr_4} (BACK TO THE SAME WALLET)
    charms:
      $01: 69000 (CALCULATE)
"""

-------------------------------

Then we send to the wallet API:

From WALLET

> Funding UTXOid:number (check that we have one available)
> spell json
> destination address (is it needed ?)

In API WALLET
we will create here 2 txs (may be calling the Charms API or doing it using Charms SDK):
1 - commit tx using the funding UTXO
2 - cast transaction (spell json + app_bins) | contains the spell and proof in the witness

In WALLET
The raw tx are sent back to the Wallet, and those are prompted to be signed by the user

In API WALLET
We cast the TX to the Testnet4 BTC node
